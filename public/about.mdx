I'm a 18 year old brazilian programmer, osu! player, and PL designer.

I love cats, weird songs, and some drugs like JavaScript, Rust and OCaml.

One of the reasons this blog exists is my desire to write in English in a less robotic way ;) and write about some formal computing subjects like PL design, type theory and compilers, in short, subjects that I find interesting
